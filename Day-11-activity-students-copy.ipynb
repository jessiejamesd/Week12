It is used when the dependent variable is binary(0/1, True/False, Yes/No) in nature. It supports categorizing data into discrete classes by studying the relationship from a given set of labelled data._\n","  * Pros:\n","    * Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.\n","    * It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space.\n","    * It can easily extend to multiple classes(multinomial regression) and a natural probabilistic view of class predictions.\n","  * Cons:\n","    * If the number of observations is lesser than the number of features, Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise, it may lead to overfitting.\n","    * It constructs linear boundaries.\n","    * The major limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\n","\n","* K-NN\n","\n","_K- Nearest Neighbors or also known as K-NN belong to the family of supervised machine learning algorithms which means we use labeled (Target Variable) dataset to predict the class of new data point.

To classify the new data point K-NN algorithm reads through whole dataset to find out K nearest neighbors.\n","    * **K-NN has no assumptions:** K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm which means there are assumptions to be met to implement K-NN. Parametric models like linear regression has lots of assumptions to be met by data before it can be implemented which is not the case with K-NN.\n","    * **No Training Step:** K-NN does not explicitly build any model, it simply tags the new data entry based learning from historical data. New data entry would be tagged with majority class in the nearest neighbor.\n","    * **It constantly evolves:** Given it’s an instance-based learning; k-NN is a memory-based approach. The classifier immediately adapts as we collect new training data.
